      <p class="text-justify text-indent">My project is a blog developed using Node.js, a robust and efficient platform
        for web applications. The blog allows users to explore a variety of article categories and interact through
        comments, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for readers.</p>
      <p class="text-justify text-indent">To enhance the functionality and user experience, I utilized several key
        libraries and
        tools. The Express framework was used to build the core server-side functionality, allowing for efficient
        routing
        and middleware integration. Body-parser was employed to handle incoming request bodies, making it easier to
        parse
        and manipulate data sent by users. For the frontend, Handlebars was chosen as the templating engine, enabling
        dynamic content rendering and seamless user interactions.</p>
      <p class="text-justify text-indent"> blog's data is managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that offers
        flexibility and
        scalability. This choice ensures that the application can handle a growing amount of data efficiently. Overall,
        the combination of these technologies has resulted in a powerful and user-friendly blog platform, showcasing the
        capabilities of modern web development with Node.js.</p>
